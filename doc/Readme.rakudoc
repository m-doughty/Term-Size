=head2 STATUS

This module allows retrieval of various terminal size metrics on Mac OS & Linux systems.

It can get this information from the Kitty escape sequence protocol (also supported on
Wezterm & Rio) with a fallback to ioctl.

Windows support is not planned at this time as getting cell size on Windows is a nightmare.
